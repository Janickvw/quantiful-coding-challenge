## quantiful-coding-challenge

Test for prospective FED interns

Summary: This challange was quite fun as I hadn't done react in a while and it was my first time using material react UI. I approched this task by spending some time reading through the code already provided and then spending some time looking through the material react ui documentation. In the end I used material table (https://github.com/mbrn/material-table) to display the fetched data as I though this allowed for the simplist and most user friendly display.

In my implemenation of this challenge, I managed to incorperate the following features: > The ability to sort in either ascending or descending order by ID, Index, Country, Value, Store and Returned status. > Search bar which searches all of the fields for the inputted text. > Seperate search filtering for ID. > Ability to filter by items return status, country and different stores.

Due to some time conflicts with current university assigments I was unable to finish the ability to change the currency the sales are viewed in.

Hope you enjoy using my version of the challenge :)
Thanks!

p.s. there is an error in the console. This isn't of concern just waiting to be fixed in material-table: https://github.com/mbrn/material-table/issues/657
